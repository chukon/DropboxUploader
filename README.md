DropboxUploader
===============

Just a quick app done as a coding challenge and for some Swift practice.

* The app lets you upload photos to a Dropbox folder.
* It lists the contents of that folder.
* You can view an image by picking it in the list.

To set up the app, you need to create a Dropbox API app here:

https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create

Then put the app 'key' and 'secret' into the appropriate spots in 'DropboxManager.swift' and you're good to go!
